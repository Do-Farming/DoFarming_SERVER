This service is the subject of [GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3) among the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

Depression is sometimes referred to as a cold in the heart.
However, people who catch a cold and are suicidal are not seen around them.    
Nevertheless, the reason for comparing it to a cold is that it is that common. But, it should not be neglected or overlooked lightly like a cold.    
As more and more people suffer from depression, I thought about solving this problem.

That's why we would like to offer a mental health service called FINNA.
> FINNA is a word that means going to or gonna in American slangs and shows the will to do.

Through several functions, we have created a service that users can easily use and motivate.   
For more information on how to use it, please refer to.
